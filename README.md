# tjekket.dk Coding Challenge
- The challenge consists of creating a simple REST-based API. Using NodeJS you should create a REST API for a simple shopping list, that can be run locally on a development machine.

## The REST API should contain the following features:

- Your solution should include a CRUD for the shopping list.
- Your solution should include a CRUD for items on the shopping list.
- User access control (Owner has RW access while Buyer has Read-only access).
- Your solution should include a README file that explains how to run the service locally and run any tests there if provided.


## Bonus:

- Test coverage of your code.
- Using our Core API (https://developers.shopgun.com/v2) for finding an offer to add to list

General Notes:

- You can use frameworks or libraries of your choice.
